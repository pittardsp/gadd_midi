# Gadd MIDI Files

These are some MIDI files I generated using methods described in my YouTube video at http: If you load them you will have assign the MIDI notes to trigger the correct sounds which will be a bass drum, snare, hi hat (closed, half open, or open). This could be confusing I know. I have included an Ableton Live 9 file that loads everything for you but of course you will have to have a copy of Ableton. I know I created the video in Reason but I was working on a project wherein I cleaned up the initial work I did in Reason for an Abelton user. I will get around to putting the MIDI files in a Reason file also.
