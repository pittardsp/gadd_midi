# Gadd MIDI Files

These are some Steve Gadd style MIDI files I generated using methods described in my YouTube video at https://youtu.be/xv3HWX8HZeU If you load them you will have yo assign the MIDI notes to trigger the correct sounds which will be a bass drum, snare, hi hat (closed, half open, or open). However, if you have Abelton Live, I have included an Ableton Live 9 set that loads everything for you.
