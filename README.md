# Gadd MIDI Files

These are some Steve Gadd style MIDI files I generated using methods described in my YouTube video at https://youtu.be/xv3HWX8HZeU If you load them you will have to assign the MIDI notes to trigger the correct sounds which will be a bass drum, snare, hi hat (closed, half open, or open). That's the cool thing about Gadd - he uses a basic kit and gets a lot of mileage out of it. However, if you have Abelton Live, I have included an Ableton Live 9 set that loads everything for you.
